        trends in the USA, I was honored. Besides Daniele being a great fellow,
        I am second-generation Italian-American; my family comes from San Marino
        (Corradi) and Abruzzo (Chiacchieri).

        >Americans first started distilling rums in the mid-1660s, with a
        multitude of distilleries popping up throughout the east coast. Molasses
        was a staple of trade throughout the New World, and easy to ferment. It
        took the American Revolution in the 18th Century to change trade and
        imports, resulting in a shortage of molasses; Americans turned to grains
        and starting making whiskey.</em

        >Today, a rising number of microdistillers and artisan distillers are
        experimenting, creating, and marketing their rum products. Some search
        to recapture American history, while others note the current trends in
        changing American tastes. The beer market is either leveling out or
        dropping, depending upon who talks to you. Cocktails, however, are
        exploding in popularity, in both traditional and new forms. The American
        sweet tooth is as strong as ever, and mixology recipes often reflect
        this fact. The HBO television series ‘Sex And The City’ stimulated an
        already rising interest in cocktails, and soon bars and restaurants
        nationwide starting offering their own concoctions. Premium spirits
        sales are also rising, although lagging behind the mixology products.
        Flavored rums are selling very well.</em
